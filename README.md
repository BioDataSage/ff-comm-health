# Vulnerability Drivers Analysis

## Goal

This project moves beyond just where vulnerability is and answers "why"

## Concept

Symptom vs. Diagnosis

-   The overall SVI score will represent symptoms
-   The four theme scores will represent the diagnosis

This project will aim to provide a visualisation that shows both the symptom and diagnosis at a glance (preferably a map)

## Question

For a particular state, what is the main driver of Social vulnerability??
