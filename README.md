## 📋 Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis and interactive dashboard for predicting Quality of Life (QoL) outcomes in community health settings. The project leverages machine learning algorithms to identify key determinants of patient well-being and provide clinical decision support tools for healthcare optimization.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Predict Quality of Life scores** using patient demographics, biomechanical measures, and service utilization patterns
- **Identify key determinants** of patient satisfaction and health outcomes
- **Compare machine learning models** (Linear Regression vs Random Forest) for predictive accuracy
- **Provide interactive tools** for healthcare professionals to explore patient data and generate predictions
- **Generate evidence-based recommendations** for intervention strategies and program optimization

## 🔬 Methodology

### Analytical Approach

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Descriptive statistics and distribution analysis
   - Correlation analysis and feature relationships
   - Subgroup comparisons (ANOVA, t-tests)
   - Visualization of demographic and clinical patterns

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Mobility Index (composite biomechanical score)
   - Engagement Score (visit frequency quantification)
   - Age group stratification
   - Satisfaction categorization

3. **Predictive Modeling**
   - **Linear Regression:** Baseline interpretable model
   - **Random Forest:** Ensemble method for non-linear relationships
   - 80/20 train-test split with stratification
   - 5-fold cross-validation
   - Hyperparameter tuning

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - R-squared (R²)
   - Residual analysis
   - Subgroup performance assessment

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```r
# Install required packages
install.packages(c(
  "shiny",
  "shinydashboard",
  "tidyverse",
  "plotly",
  "DT",
  "randomForest",
  "caret",
  "knitr",
  "kableExtra",
  "corrplot",
  "psych",
  "car",
  "viridis",
  "patchwork"
))
```

### Running the Interactive Dashboard

```r
# Launch the Shiny application
shiny::runApp("app.R")
```

The dashboard provides:
- **Real-time QoL predictions** based on patient parameters
- **Interactive data exploration** with filtering and visualization
- **Model performance comparison** with diagnostic plots
- **Clinical interpretation** with actionable recommendations

### Generating the Analysis Report

```r
# Render the Quarto presentation
quarto::quarto_render("analysis.qmd")
```

## 📈 Key Findings

### Model Performance

| Model | RMSE | MAE | R² |
|-------|------|-----|-----|
| Linear Regression | 13.45 | 10.82 | 0.342 |
| Random Forest | 11.23 | 8.97 | 0.489 |

**Random Forest outperforms Linear Regression** across all metrics, capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between predictors.

### Top Predictors of Quality of Life

1. **Patient Satisfaction** (most important)
2. **Service Type**
3. **Visit Frequency**
4. **EMG Activity Level**
5. **Age**

### Clinical Insights

- **Strong positive correlation** between patient satisfaction and QoL (r = 0.45, p < 0.001)
- **Service type matters:** Preventive care shows highest average QoL scores
- **Engagement effect:** Weekly visits associated with better outcomes (p = 0.032)
- **Biomechanical function:** High EMG activity predicts better QoL
- **Age-related patterns:** Middle-aged adults (31-45) show optimal outcomes
